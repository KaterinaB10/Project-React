# React-project

Welcome to our project! We're three people working on creating a project in association with Kodehode and/or Jobloop. This project focuses on working with React and Vite. The goal is to create a blog for beginners, up-and-coming, and returning developers alike.

In this project, we'll be using:
- Figma (for planning) 
https://www.figma.com/file/h8WThvPDq1ZQOElEA9BRzU/Project-React?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=FwJkUV1etdmxKPfj-0 
- React
- Vite
- Html
- CSS
- JavaScript
- and Conduit API
https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/blob/main/api/openapi.yml 

The reasoning behind this is because it's good practice for us, and if we manage to do this properly, then we'll have an easier time with our future projects.

Our project can be reached at [provide URL/link here], where you'll get to check out everything mentioned above.

The project shouldn't be that difficult to use when completed and should, in theory, be accessible for everyone.

Authors and developers of the project:
- Trond-Morten Reknes
- Katerina Bredikhina
